    <h1>Step 1 - 
        Find a comfortable place to practice. One of the many beauties of yoga is that you can do it just about anywhere! If you want to start an at-home yoga practice, first make sure you have a quiet place to flow with plenty of space to move around. Remove all distractions, like TVs, radios, phones, and other people.</h1>
     <h1> Step 2 - Devote a set amount of time to flow. Yoga is all about clearing your mind and focusing on you and your body, and you can’t fully commit to the practice if you don’t schedule it into your day. Make room in your schedule to practice— showing up for even the shortest practice can make a big difference.
     </h1>
     <h1>
        Step 3- 
        Set a goal for your yoga practice. Before you begin, ask yourself why you want to start doing yoga—what do you want to get out of your practice? Perhaps you want to get stronger, become more flexible, or ease anxiety. This goal will help you find the perfect practice for you
