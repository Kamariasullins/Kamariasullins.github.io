                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!--  -->
                <p> You add a declaration for the position property with the value then you add the declaration of the other value and then for the top and specify a zero value.</p>

            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p> Add a declaration for the position property with the value of relative. Add another declaration for thr top property and specify a value of 90 px. Add another declarationfor thr left property with a value of 30 px. </p>

                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>Add a declaration for the position property with a value of fixed. Add another declaration for the top property and specify a value of 90 px and then do that for the right of 90px</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>Add a declaration for the position property with a value of absolute. Add a declaration for the right property and set to 90px. Do the same for the bottom and set to 0</p>
